Phase: conclusion

QUESTIONS TECHNIQUES:
1. FastAPI is described as a modern Python web framework that leverages Python's type hints. (fastapi_tutorial.txt::chunk-10) Can you explain how type hints contribute to the efficiency and development speed in FastAPI, and what benefits they offer in terms of code maintainability and reducing errors?
   Réponse: it makes the code simple as possible

2. FastAPI is known for its speed and efficiency. According to 'fastapi_tutorial.txt::chunk-10', it leverages Starlette and Pydantic. Can you explain how these libraries contribute to FastAPI's performance and what are their individual roles?
   Réponse: yes it contribute to minimize code

3. FastAPI utilizes ASGI with Uvicorn for asynchronous operations. According to 'fastapi_tutorial.txt::chunk-17', why is ASGI preferred over WSGI for asyncio applications in FastAPI, and what benefits does Uvicorn provide?
   Réponse: i don't know this term

4. Based on 'fastapi_tutorial.txt::chunk-65', FastAPI uses `TemplateResponse` with Jinja2 for rendering HTML. Can you explain the purpose of the `request: Request` parameter in the `hello` function and how it's used within the `TemplateResponse`?
   Réponse: it make the compilation more fast

5. According to 'fastapi_tutorial.txt::chunk-90', FastAPI's dependency injection system makes it easier to integrate components. Can you explain the advantages of using dependency injection in FastAPI, particularly in the context of reusability and testability?
   Réponse: with constructur or pom file

QUESTIONS SOFT SKILLS:
1. According to 'fastapi_tutorial.txt::chunk-135', FastAPI uses `app.add_middleware()` to handle requests. Can you describe the purpose of the `call_next()` function within a custom middleware in FastAPI and explain how it's used to process the request?
   Réponse: No
